# The followings are not any kind of setting for Tmux, but crucial to my
# own productivity. Setting them up is really pain, and I probably going to
# forget it. So I'm just putting them here again.

######## iTerm + Tmux key integration #########
# First of all, iTerm can send hex codes for shortcuts you define. So for
# example you can send a hex code for the shortcut "c-f v" which in my case
# opens a vertical pane (see setting above). The hex code for this combination
# is: 0x06 0x76. There are many cases to find it out. One of them is the tool
# 'xxd'

# If you run "xxd -psd" and hit "c-f v" and then enter and finally c-c to exit
# , it outputs the following:
#
# 	$ xxd -psd
# 	^Fv
# 	06760a^C
#
# What matters is the sequence  06760a^C where:
#
# 	06 -> c-f
# 	76 -> v
# 	0a -> return
#	^C -> c-c
#
# From here, we know that 0x06 0x76 corresponds to "c-f v".
#
# Finally, inside the iTerm2 Key settings, I'm adding just various shortcuts,
# such as cmd-j, cmd-left, etc.. , select the option "send hex code" and the
# enter the hex code which I want to be executed, hence the tmux sequence. So
# when I press CMD + d in iterm, I send the sequence 0x06 0x76,
# which tmux inteprets it as opening a new pane.

######## Alacritty + Tmux key integration #########
# First of all, Alacritty can send hex codes for shortcuts you define. So for
