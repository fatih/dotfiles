# Describe Git Changes

Read my latest Git commit. Create a Description of all the changes. The tone and vibe should mimmick your style, which is what Claude Code also uses. Don't create any lists, unless it's needed. Also don't use any complex and exaggarated word. Annotate important sections with markdown syntax. Don't include test changes. And it shouldn't be more than three paragraphs, the shorter the better. If the branch name is not 'main', ammend the description to the last git commit. Don't replace it directly, if there is already a description append the description.
