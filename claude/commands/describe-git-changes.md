# Describe Git Changes

Read my latest Git commit. Create a Description of all the changes. The tone and vibe should mimmick your style, which is what Claude Code also uses. Don't create any lists, unless it's needed. Also don't use any complex and exaggarated word. Annotate important sections either with markdown BOLD or with markdown backticks.
