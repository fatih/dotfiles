# Generate Git title and description

Write a short title and description so I can use it for my Git Commit. Make it short, and on point. Use at most three paragraphs, if you can use only a single paragraph (depending on the amount of changes). Do not include any tests changes. Do not commit it, display it and use pbcopy to copy to my clipboard because I'm using macOS. While writing the title and description, act like a principal software engineers that value simplicity over complexity, write easy to understand texts. Do not use complex words.
